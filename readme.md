__Overview__

- I recorded data for 700 Elden Ring invasions across 6 different levels to compare the experience in different invasion brackets.
- Platform: PC, patch 1.10
- Brackets Tested (`Level +Standard/+Somber Upgrades`):
	- RL 20 +2/+1
	- RL 40 +5/+2
	- RL 61 +12/+5
	- RL 80 +18/+6
	- RL 95 +20/+8
	- RL 138 +25/+10
- The 6 brackets tested cover all NG progression brackets (from RL18 to RL171)
- Main parameters of interest:
	- `Invasion activity` (number of bloody finger / recusant finger activations). Alternating between the fingers resets your position in queue and leads to faster invasions. A lower number means more activity.
	- `Invasion Location` (general map region & whether it was open-world or dungeon).
	- `Type of invasion` (E.g., Organic vs. gank)
	- `Type of Host` (i.e., experience level)
	- Presence of a `Co-Invader` or `OLP` (largely based on subjective assessment unless I killed them and got runes to confirm) or .

__Findings at each Bracket__

__RL 20 +2/+1__

- __Activity:__
	- 9/10.
	- 75% of invasions occurred within 6 finger activations.
- __Invasion Locations:__
	- Primarily Limgrave, Weeping, and Stormveil. Liurnia, Ray Lucaria, and Caelid to a lesser extent.
	- Only bracket that consistently invaded Stormveil.
	- Other than Stormveil and Castle Morne, most invasions were open world. 10% of invasions were mini-dungeons.
- __Types of Invasions and Hosts:__
	- RL 20 is very mixed as some invasions are noob-stomps while others that involve an OLP or gank are super sweaty.
	- 68% of invasions were organic invasions or non-bonfire duels, and most players are completely new or intermediate.
	- However, 11% of invasions were ganks, and often involved highly twinked hosts and OLPs.
	- 32% of invasions involved an OLP.



__RL 40 +5/+2__

- __Activity:__
	- 4/10.
	- Least active bracket tested. 75% of invasions occurred within 13 finger activations.
	- Still had decent activity, but during non-peak times this bracket was often dead.
	- I only did 58 invasions at this bracket because I got bored waiting for invasions.
	- Weapon upgrade +6 may capture slightly more activity but I did not test it.
- __Invasion Locations:__
	- Primarily Liurnia, Ray Lucaria, and Caelid. Limgrave, Weeping, and Siofra River to a lesser extent.
	- 22% of invasions were in mini-dungeons.
- __Types of Invasions and Hosts:__
	- RL 40 is similar to RL 20 but has fewer ganks (4% vs. 11%).
	- 66% of invasions were organic invasions or non-bonfire duels, and most players were intermediate.
	- 30% of invasions involved an OLP.


__RL 61 +12/+5__

- Note: only reason why its RL61 and not RL60 is because I wanted an extra stat point and was too lazy to rebirth.
- __Activity:__
	- 8/10.
	- 75% of invasions occurred within 7 finger activations.
- __Invasion Locations:__
	- Primarily Liurnia, Caelid/Dragonbarrow, Underground regions, Altus, and Leyndell.
	- 25% of invasions were mini-dungeons and 29% were legacy dungeons (Raya Lucaria, Leyndell).
	- This is the best bracket for invading into Leyndell.
- __Types of Invasions and Hosts:__
	- RL 61 was the most "organic" invasion bracket (but only marginally more than RL 40, 80, and 95).
	- 75% of invasions were organic invasions or non-bonfire duels. 6% were ganks.
	- There is a relatively mix of new, intermediate, and veteran players. Compared to RL40, it felt like there were more straight up noobs.
	- 19% of invasions involved an OLP.


__RL 80 +18/+6__

- __Activity:__
	- 6/10.
	- 75% of invasions occurred within 9 finger activations.
- __Invasion Locations:__
	- Locations are similar to RL61, but as expected, there is a slight shift from earlier areas to later areas.
	- There is less Liurnia, and Caelid/Dragonbarrow. There is more Altus Pleateau, Mountintops, and sometimes Haligtree.
- __Types of Invasions and Hosts:__
	- Overall, a very similar bracket to RL 61. I suggest choosing based on invasion locations and/or activity.
	- 65% of invasions were organic invasions or non-bonfire duels. 8% were ganks.
	- There is a relatively even mix of new, intermediate, and veteran players (very similar to RL 61).
	- 16% of invasions involved an OLP.


__RL 95 +20/+8__

- __Activity:__
	- 7/10.
	- 75% of invasions occurred within 8 finger activations.
- __Invasion Locations:__
	- Locations are very similar to RL80, but as expected, there is a slight shift from earlier areas to later areas.
	- Notably, this bracket has more Haligtree and Farum Azula invasions compared to earlier brackets.
- __Types of Invasions and Hosts:__
	- Generally, it is a similar bracket to RL80 but with a slight shift to later areas.
	- 68% of invasions were organic invasions or non-bonfire duels.
	- There are fewer straight up noobs at this level; Most players (65%) are intermediate. 20% of players were veterans, which is a similar number to RL 40, 61, and 80.
	- 8% of invasions involved an OLP.
	- This bracket barely excludes meta level (invades up to RL124+25) but had the lowest chance of invading into a gank (3% were ganks) and the lowest chance of encountering hosts exhibiting maidenless behaviour of all the brackets tested.
	- I had never tried this bracket prior to this experiment but it became one of my favourite brackets since you can still sometimes invade endgame areas without constantly invading into ganks.



__RL 138 +25/+10__

- __Activity:__
	- 10/10.
	- 75% of invasions occurred within 5 finger activations.
- __Invasion Locations:__
	- Limgrave, Liurnia, Altus, Mountaintops, Haligtree, and Farum Azula were the most common.
	- Only 15% of invasions were mini-dungeons, 36% were open world and 39% were legacy dungeons.
- __Types of Invasions and Hosts:__
	- This is the meta level bracket and is the sweatiest bracket by far. It is fun its own way, but it is a completely different invasion experience from every other bracket.
	- 45% of invasions were organic invasions or non-bonfire duels, while 23% were ganks and 19% were bonfire duelists.
	- Very few players were straight up "noobs". 17% of hosts exhibited morbidly maidenless behaviour, which was by far the highest proportion of all the brackets.
	- 60% of hosts were experienced players (veteran or maidenless hosts), compared to ~20-25% for most other brackets.
	-  23% of invasions involved a co-invader. This was the only bracket where having a co-invader was remotely common (the next closest bracket is RL 95 at 7%).
	- 20% of hosts were rune arc'd.



__General Findings__

- 18% of invasions resulted in no activity due to fogwall, connection errors, or host dying before I arrived. It was 14% at RL 20 and increased up to ~20% at higher levels.
- I began 91% of my invasions with a wave. 44% of teams gestured back.
- The most common emotes after killing me were bow (53), wave (26), T bag (23), and point down (13).


___TLDR__

- The invasion experience can be roughly grouped into 3 buckets:
	- The low level bracket (RL 20) is a mixed bag of newer players sprinkled in with OLPs.
	- The mid-level brackets (RL 40, 60, 80, and 95) generally get you more organic invasions. Your choice may depend on activity, your build, what areas you like to invade, and how often you want to deal with OLPs.
	- The meta level bracket (RL 138) is the sweatiest bracket and players are better than in other brackets. About half of the invasions in this bracket are TT hosts (ganks, bonfire duelists, and 2v2s).
- I recommend all invasion enthusiasts try out the low, mid, and meta level brackets to find what you like or to add variety/
